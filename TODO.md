* Add non-filesystem aware path normalizing (i.e. to remove "." at the end): maybe not necessary since for local we always call function that gets the repo git path
* Name is still incorrect, hash is also not correct. Secrets need to really work!
* Secret command gets local address with set URL
* RUST_LOG? sometimes it shows debug
* Error printing is not very pretty yet
